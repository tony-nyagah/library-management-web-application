# Library Management Application
An application made to test my skills and knowledge ðŸ™‚


## The Synopsis
A local library is in dire need of a web application to ease their work. The library management system must allow a librarian to track books and their quantity, books issued to members, book fees.

For the sake of simplicity, you don't have to implement sessions and roles, you can assume that the app will be used by the librarian only.

The following functionalities are expected from the application:

Base Library System

Librarians must be able to maintain:
* Books with stock maintained
* Members
* Transactions

The use cases included here are to:
* Perform general CRUD operations on Books and Members
* Issue a book to a member
* Issue a book return from a member
* Search for a book by name and author
* Charge a rent fee on book returns
* Make sure a memberâ€™s outstanding debt is not more than KES.500
## Tech Stack

**Client:** A JavaScript framework such as React or Vue.

**Server:** Flask


## Roadmap

### Understanding the Problem
The first step of the project is to understand the problem to be solved. The library needed a system to manage books, members, and transactions.

### Designing the Application
Before writing any code, the application is designed. The key entities and their attributes were identified, the relationships between entities defined, and application views were sketched.

### Setting Up the Environment
Next, the development environment is set up, which included installing necessary software, setting up the Git repository and setting up the Python virtual environment.

### Building the Backend
With the design in hand, the backend is built. The Flask application is set up, the database schema is defined and created using SQLAlchemy, and the API endpoints were implemented.

### Building the Frontend
Once the backend is complete, the frontend is built. The React application is set up, components were created, and these components were connected to the Flask backend.

### Testing
With both the frontend and backend complete, the next step is testing. Manual testing is performed to ensure all functions worked as expected. Unit tests were also written for both the frontend and backend.

### Deployment
With a working, tested system, the project is deployed. The Flask application is deployed on a server and the React application is also deployed. Any API endpoints in the frontend code were updated to point to the deployed backend.

## Final Thoughts
At the end of the project, reflections were made on the challenges, what could be done differently in a real-world situation, and potential improvements for this project.
